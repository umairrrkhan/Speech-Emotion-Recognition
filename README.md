# Speech Emotion Recognition

## Overview

This project is a Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) system that can automatically detect and classify emotions from spoken language. It is designed to analyze audio input and determine the emotional state of the speaker, which has various applications in human-computer interaction, customer service, and mental health monitoring.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Python 3.6 or later installed on your system.
- Required Python packages installed (see [Installation](#installation)).
- Audio recording or streaming capability.

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/umairrrkhan/speech-emotion-recognition.git
   ```

## Usage

### Supported Emotions

This SER system currently supports the following emotions:

- Happiness
- Sadness
- Anger
- Fear
- Neutral

### API Usage

You can also use this SER system as a Python API. Import the SpeechEmotionRecognition class from emotion_recognition.py and use the recognize_emotion method to analyze audio and get emotion predictions programmatically.



## How It Works

### Feature Extraction

The SER system extracts various audio features such as pitch, intensity, and spectral characteristics to create feature vectors that represent the speech. These features are then used as input to a machine learning model.

### Emotion Classification

The system uses a trained machine learning model, typically based on deep neural networks or other classifiers, to classify the emotion based on the extracted features. The model has been trained on a labeled dataset containing examples of speech with known emotions.
